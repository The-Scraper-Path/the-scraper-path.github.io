    <p>Hey!</p>
    <p>I’m Marc and I’ve been working on the scraping world for some years. If there’s something I realized during this time, apart from how interesting and challenging this world is, is that becoming good at it requires a set of very specific skills, and it seems that there’s a general lack of good resources explaining those different topics.</p>
